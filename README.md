# Bullet Hell Game
This game was created using soley JavaFX, GSON, and Java standard libaries. Those responsible for this creation were apart of UTSA's Application Programming Class (cs3443 Group 5). This was our semester project and decided to make a "Bullet Hell" style game to get more familiar with JavaFX and its many libaries. Thanks for playing!

# Coding Style
We decided on the Google Java Coding Style for some consistency with the project. We were all forced to collaborate on this game remotely due to COVID-19 and the wishes of everyone invovled with the project. This made it easy for us to work on our seperate pieces of the game at our own available times while keeping everyone on the same page.
